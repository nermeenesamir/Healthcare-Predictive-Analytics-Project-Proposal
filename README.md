# Healthcare-Predictive-Analytics-Project-Proposal
This project aims to develop a healthcare predictive analytics system using data science and machine learning techniques to enhance early risk assessment and support clinical decision-making. By analyzing patient demographic, clinical, and lifestyle data, the system identifies patterns associated with potential health risks. 
Project Objectives:
•
Analyze healthcare data to identify key risk factors associated with stroke
•
Perform exploratory data analysis to understand medical and lifestyle patterns
•
Build and evaluate machine learning models for stroke risk prediction
•
Deliver an accurate and interpretable healthcare prediction system
